The guide provides a step-by-step process to start developing React Native applications using the Expo framework, 
without using EAS (Expo Application Services). It lists the requirements for setting up the environment, such as Node, 
Android Studio, and Xcode. The guide demonstrates how to install and set up the development environment, 
including selecting 'Development build' and unchecking the option for Build with Expo Application Services. The guide also provides additional 
tips on using commands like npx expo start, npx expo prebuild, and npx expo run:android/run:ios to compile and run the applications.

# Starting React Native Development with Expo (without EAS) üì±

This guide serves as a reference to start development using React Native with the Expo framework. As
a react developer, I had started developing react native applications using the react-native CLI.
However, over the years, the following react-native CLI tool has not been supported and there are
other Frameworks that support react-native development. One such framework is the Expo framework.
This guide will showcase the steps required to build and run a bare React Native application using
the expo framework.

Requirements:

- NodeJS
- Android Studio (Android development) ü§ñ
- Xcode (iOS development) üçé

To install NodeJS, there are options to download an installer for the given operating system.
However, it is recommended to use NVM(Node version Manager) to help install, uninstall, and switch
nodejs versions as needed. There are steps and methods to install NodeJS on the given page. Once
Nodejs has been installed, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest

bunx create expo my-app
```

To set up the development environment for Android or iOS or both, there is a detailed explanation on
the installation process to install Android Studio and Xcode at the given page. However, this guide
selects the option of using 'Development build' and unchecks the option for
`Build with Expo Application Services (EAS)` as we would want the development and build process to
be done locally instead of running on EAS. There is an option to build/run the application on a real
device or emulator/simulator for development and testing purposes.

Once the environment has been set up, run the following command:

```bash
npx expo run:android/run:ios

bunx expo run:android/run:ios
```

The following command should run the project on the chosen platform on the choice of device or
emulator/simulator.

Next step of the project is to remove the boilerplate generated when running
`npx create-expo-app@latest| bun create expo my-app` command to create a new Expo application.

```bash
npm run reset-project

bun run reset-project
```

Additional Tips:

| Command                         | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx expo start`                | Starts the development server (whether you are using a development build or Expo Go)                                                     |
| `npx expo prebuild`             | Generates native Android and iOS directories using 'Prebuild', rebuilds the file directories by adding `--clean` option to this command. |
| `npx expo run:android`          | Compiles native Android app locally.                                                                                                     |
| `npx expo run:ios`              | Compiles native iOS app locally.                                                                                                         |
| `npx expo install pacakge-name` | Used to install a new library or validate and update specific libraries in your project by adding `--fix` option to this command.        |
| `npx expo lint`                 | Setups and configures ESLint. If ESLint is already configured, this command will lint your project files.                                |
