# Up and running Husky üê∂

A quick guide on how to install, setup and run husky. What is husky ? It is a pre-git hook command that
runs linting, test and building on your project upon committing and pushing.

1. **Install husky**
   ```bash
   bun add --dev husky
   ```
2. **Init husky**
   ```bash
   bunx husky init
   ```
3. **Update `scripts` in package.json**
   ```json
   {
   ...,
   "scripts":{
       ...,
       "lint-staged": "lint-staged"
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Add the following script code to `package.json` file**

   ```json
   "scripts": {
       ...,
   },
   "dependencies": {
       ...,
   },
   "devDependencies": {
       ...,
   },
   "lint-staged": {
       "**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json}": [
       "eslint --ext .js,.ts.,tsx,.astro src",
       "prettier --plugin-search-dir=. --write",
       "astro build"
       ]
   },
   ```

5. **Update the `pre-commit` file located in `.husky` folder**
   ```bash
   bunx lint-staged
   ```

Once everything is setup, you can test it once you have `git add` and `git commit`. The following `lint-staged` script will check your files, prettify and build your project before readying your project for push.
